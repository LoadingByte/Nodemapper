Nodemapper
==========

Nodemapper is a powerful tool for creating trees using a GUI software.

Usage
-----

When you start a new tree, you will only have one node with the content "Root". You can double-click on the text to edit it to something else.

You can add a new link to another node by clicking on the border of a node and dragging the line to the other node. If there's no node, the program will create a new one. If you link to nodes together a second time, the link will be removed.
